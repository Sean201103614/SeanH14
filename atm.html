			<h1>6th Grade ATM</h2>
			<ul><p>6th Grade ATM was a crazy experience because it was a whole new transition from 5th grade chorus. 
				I learned how to use many programs that I've never even heard of before like Microsoft word, Microsoft Excel. In 6th grade I had to practice typing non-stop,
				 obviously I wasen't amused about it but It was part of a grade so I had no choice but to learn. 6th grade ATM was crazy but in time I knew I would 
				 get use to it.
				</p></ul>

			<h1>7th Grade ATM</h2>
			<ul><p>7th grade ATM I was worried about typing again because It wasen't my best skill nor interest. But I learned how to use many other awesome things
